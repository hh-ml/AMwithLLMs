Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.\n",
      "Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.\n",
      "Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.\n",

Essay:\\nReading fictions is more pleasant\\n\\nThere are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.\\nFirstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.\\nSecondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.\\nSome people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.\\nTo sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.\\n\\nB.

To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.\\nHowever, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. \\nWhat is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.\\nIn conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons.

Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.\\nPhysical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.\\nDaily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.\\nHaving children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. \\nIncluding physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.\\n\\nB.

Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\\nA student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\\nAnother reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\\nIn addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.\\nThus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies.

Essay:\\nOnce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\\n\\nAchieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.\\nFirst, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.\\nSecond, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.\\nIn conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success.

Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.\\nTo begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors' duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.\\nOn the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.\\nNevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.\\nConsequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students' solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.\\n\\nB.

Essay:\\nLiving with a roommate is better than Living alone\\n\\nMany single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.\\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.\\nApart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.\\nFinally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.\\nIn conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.\\n\\nB.

Essay:\\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance.\\n\\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.\\nTo begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.\\nAdditionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.\\nFinally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.\\nIn conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.\\n\\nB.
